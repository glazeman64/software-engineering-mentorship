# software-engineering-mentorship
I am Gegele Abubakar modibo, a native of Ilorin, Kwara state. I'm an 100 level student at the Library and information science of the university of ilorin,Kwara State. My passions are exploring, trying new things, reading, and working on new ideas. I'm a big fan of soccer and a social individual. 
My love for exploration and problem solving led me to find tech. and the opportunities therein. I want to be able to create products that will improve life and solve people problems globally. I want to not just be a software engineer, but an individual that solves societal problems. 

I look forward to gaining immensely from this program and giving back to it.
